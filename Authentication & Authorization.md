<h1>Authentication & Authorization</h1>

<p>
  Authorization and authentication are two essential components of access control in the field of cybersecurity. 
  While the terms are often used together, they serve very different purposes, and understanding the difference is key to designing secure systems.
</p>

<p>
  Before someone can do anything in a system, they must first prove who they are, and then the system must decide what they're allowed to do.
</p>

<h2>1) Authentication (Identity)</h2>
<p>
  Authentication is about <strong>identity</strong> — verifying that a user is who they claim to be.
</p>

<h2>2) Authorization (Privileges)</h2>
<p>
  Authorization is about <strong>privileges</strong> — controlling what actions or data the user can access after they've been authenticated.
</p>

<p>
  Together, these mechanisms help ensure that the right people have the right access to the right resources and nothing more.
</p>

<h2>Real-world Analogy</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> is like showing your ID at the building entrance.</li>
  <li><strong>Authorization</strong> is like being allowed to enter specific rooms in that building based on your role.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Together, these mechanisms help ensure that the right people have the right access to the right resources and nothing more.
