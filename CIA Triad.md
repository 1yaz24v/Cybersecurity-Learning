CIA Triad = Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

In cybersecurity CIA Triad is a model used to protect data and systems. You can think of it like 3 strong pillars that ensure the security and depndability of information. 

1. Confidentiality (Keep it Secret)
. Only the right people should see the data.
. Like locking your diary so only you can see it.
. Examples: Passwords, encryption, and access controls.

2. Integrity (Keep it Correct)
. The data must be accurate and not changed by mistake or by a hacker.
. Like making sure your school marks are not changed by someone else.
. Example: Checksums, backups, and version control.

3. Availability (Keep it Accessible)
. The data and systems should be available when needed.
. Like being able to access your bank apps whenever you want.
. Example: No server crashes, protection from DDoS attacks. 

How you can remember it: 
Confidentiality = Private
Integrity = Correct
Availablity = Ready to use
