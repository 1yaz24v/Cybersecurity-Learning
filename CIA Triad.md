<h1>CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability</h1>

<p>
  In cybersecurity, the <strong>CIA Triad</strong> is a model used to protect data and systems. 
  You can think of it like three strong pillars that ensure the security and dependability of information.
</p>

<h2>1) Confidentiality (Keep it Secret)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Only the right people should see the data.</li>
  <li>Like locking your diary so only you can see it.</li>
  <li>Examples: Passwords, encryption, and access controls.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2) Integrity (Keep it Correct)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The data must be accurate and not changed by mistake or by a hacker.</li>
  <li>Like making sure your school marks are not changed by someone else.</li>
  <li>Examples: Checksums, backups, and version control.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Availability (Keep it Accessible)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The data and systems should be available when needed.</li>
  <li>Like being able to access your bank apps whenever you want.</li>
  <li>Examples: No server crashes, protection from DDoS attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Remember It</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> = Private</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity</strong> = Correct</li>
  <li><strong>Availability</strong> = Ready to use</li>
</ul>
